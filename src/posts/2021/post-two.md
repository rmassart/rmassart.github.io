## Travelling

> You fly off to a strange land, eagerly abandoning all the comforts of home, and then expend vast quantities of time and money in a largely futile effort to recapture the comforts that you wouldn't have lost if you hadn't left home in the first place.
> Bill Bryson, Neither Here Nor There

> If you don't know where you're going, you'll end up someplace else.
> Yogi Bera

> There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.
> An old Tibetian saying

> Not all those who wander are lost.
> J.R.R.Tolkien, Fellowship of the Ring
