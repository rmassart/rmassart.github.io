# Welcome!

This is a basic starter kit for [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), with [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) for editing and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting baked in.

The site is largely based off the [Eleventy starter site](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog), which has been adapted and styled to be a simple basic blogging site. The aim is to make it as easy as possible for non-technical users to set up a blog using a static site generator. [See the full instructions here](https://cms.contentedweb.com).

Enjoy.
